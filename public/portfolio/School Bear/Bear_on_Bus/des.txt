A sad white bear sitting on a yellow bus seat, looking out the window with a single blue tear falling from its eye. The bear is thinking of something sad while traveling back to UChicago, surrounded by the green landscape outside. The minimalist cartoon style captures the bear's melancholic mood perfectly.
